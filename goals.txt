Goals In Priority:

1. Check if you can abstract the app.jsx file to make it simpler for startup and even just code cleanup
   to add something to the model output section on startup that either says like click train model or "select item"
2. Figure out if you want to add any other filtering, and also adjust the buttons to increase and decrease filters because they look bad
3. Think about replacing or removing the position filter, or beinig able to combine all the runs for each position into a single loadable model output
