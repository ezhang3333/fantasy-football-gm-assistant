Goals In Priority:

1. Create database for all the ml information using sqlite3 with python inside predict.py or somewhere else fitting
2. Create fast api endpoints that expose this model information for our react frontend
3. Have the react components extract this information and display it 
4. Create a react page that can interact with the model and retrain the model whihc would then reupdate this
   entire pipeline of database, fast api endpoint, react components
5. Fine tune the model
