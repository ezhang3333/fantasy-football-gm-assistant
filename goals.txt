Goals In Priority:
NEW PRIORITY: TEST TO SEE IF RB_CLEANER dataset returned is totally good
1. Create finalized rb dataset from rb_cleaner return dataset 
2. Create wr_and_te_cleaner 
3. Really look at all the finalized datasets and make sure everything is correct and filled properly
4. Game script feature creator for each position seperately
5. Double check datasets to make sure the calculated stats are correct (probably return the datasets by sorting and groupby)
6. Create gradient boosted tree model
7. Think about adding a game script feature for all positions
