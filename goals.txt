Goals In Priority:

1. Train Model button in bottom needs hover and focus changes and so do the model output in list and grid view
2. The list view of the model outputs doesn't look amazing
3. Think about replacing or removing the position filter, or beinig able to combine all the runs for each position into a single loadable model output
4. Hook sleeper or espn fantasy apis into our app so that we can have a user link their own fantasy leagues, add user auth and oauth, and either cookies or jwt tokens for apis  

Long Term Goals:

1. Add some sort of agent that either talks to an LLM api or uses Langchain or Hugging Face
2. Add authorizatio, probably JWT which oath and openID so that users can sign in with other websites like google, etc
3. See is it is viable to connect to sleeper leagues and espn leagues so that we can extract relevant data for a user
