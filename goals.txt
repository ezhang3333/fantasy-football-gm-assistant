3. Think about replacing or removing the position filter, or beinig able to combine all the runs for each position into a single loadable model output

2. Add authorizatio, probably JWT which oath and openID so that users can sign in with other websites like google, etc
3. See is it is viable to connect to sleeper leagues and espn leagues so that we can extract relevant data for a user
