Goals In Priority:

2. Expose selecting what season to trian, validate, and predict on to the frontend

2. Add authorizatio, probably JWT which oath and openID so that users can sign in with other websites like google, etc
3. See is it is viable to connect to sleeper leagues and espn leagues so that we can extract relevant data for a user
