Goals In Priority:
GOAL - Use model to predict future 4 week average and then compare with fantasy_pts_after_4_weeks 
       to see how close prediction is and adjust weights for model. Then you can use players with 
       high future 4 week average compared to past 4 weeks average to find buy low and sell lows.
       Then you can also do good breakout candidates with finding low waivered percentage players.

1. Create gradient boosted tree model that gets fed our final dataset as features
2. Create frontend to display and host this data
3. Think about adding a game script feature for all positions
